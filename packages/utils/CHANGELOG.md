# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [17.2.11] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- Added `repair` and `rawKeys` options to `parseFrontmatter` to support spec-conformant loading (disabling lenient recovery and preserving keys verbatim), and exported `normalizeFrontmatterKeys` for manual key normalization.

### Fixed

- Fixed the in-house `marked` list tokenizer incorrectly consuming trailing blank lines at the end of input, ensuring correct list tightness and token generation matching standard `marked` behavior.

## [17.2.10] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Introduced zero-dependency in-house modules replacing external packages, importable via `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils/<module>`: `acp` (Agent Client Protocol), `browsers` (Chrome for Testing discovery/install), `chalk` (ANSI styling), `dates` (date formatting), `dom` (HTML parser, WHATWG DOM subset, and CSS selectors), `docx` (DOCX to HTML), `headers` (browser header generation), `lru` (LRU cache), `marked` (GFM markdown lexer/parser), `readability` (article extraction), `template` (Handlebars-compatible templating), `turndown` (HTML to Markdown), `vterm` (headless terminal emulator), and `xml` (XML parser).
- Added postmortem fatal recovery hint providers to allow applications to print actionable recovery commands before cleanup starts.

### Changed

- Rewrote the logger file backend in-house, maintaining the identical line format, daily rotation, and pruning behavior without external dependencies.

### Fixed

- Fixed PowerShell (`powershell.exe` / `pwsh`) support when used as a custom `shellPath` by correctly passing `-NoLogo -Command` (and `-NoProfile` under `PI_BASH_NO_LOGIN`) instead of POSIX flags.
- Fixed the in-house `marked` list tokenizer consuming the trailing blank line into the list token when the next top-level line was a plain paragraph. The blank now always becomes a separate `space` token (matching real marked), so a list's token shape no longer depends on what follows it — restoring the TUI streaming lexer's freeze invariant — and a list followed by a paragraph is tight, not loose, per CommonMark.
- Added the missing Handlebars built-in `lookup` helper to the in-house `template` engine (`{{lookup obj key}}`, proto-safe property access; a user-registered `lookup` helper still takes precedence).

### Removed

- Removed external dependencies on `handlebars`, `winston`, and `winston-daily-rotate-file`.

## [17.2.9] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Added a public `compareVersions` utility (`@oh-my-pi/pi-utils`) that compares two version strings with SemVer-2.0 prerelease ordering, build-metadata stripping, and numeric segment comparison without float overflow; never throws.

### Fixed

- Honor the current process `PATH` when caching executable lookups, preventing stale tool paths after environment reloads.
- Parsed account-cap reset windows such as “Your limit will reset in 13 minutes” so credential backoff honors the provider's full reset duration.

## [17.2.6] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Added a shared `file-lock` utility backed by process-owned native OS locks with automatic crash release and bounded asynchronous retry.

## [17.2.5] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Added utility functions `parseFlag()`, `getBrowserRelayDir()`, and `getGlobalDaemonRuntimeDir()` to support browser relay mode and global daemon runtime directory resolution.

### Changed

- Updated the lightweight CLI runner to support static command metadata, allowing root help to render without importing full command implementations.

## [17.2.4] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Added `getSecretPlaceholderKeyPath()`, `getDaemonRuntimeDir()`, `getProviderInFlightRoot()`, and `getMarketplacesRegistryPath()` to resolve secret key, daemon runtime, provider in-flight, and marketplace registry paths under their respective XDG categories (state, data) instead of the config root.
- Existing installs enabling XDG keep their data: a legacy `~/.omp/agent/secret-placeholder.key` or `~/.omp/marketplaces.json` is copied to its XDG location on first resolution, so persisted transcripts still deobfuscate and added marketplaces survive the move.

### Changed

- Headless hosts (print/RPC/ACP/eval/SDK) now use a 1s SQLite `busy_timeout` for the session-critical databases (agent.db, history.db, stats.db) via `getDbBusyTimeoutMs()`, so lock contention no longer freezes the protocol loop for the full interactive 5s timeout; interactive hosts keep the 5s timeout.

### Fixed

- Fixed Bun test-runtime detection treating application-owned `NODE_ENV=test` and `BUN_ENV=test` values as test-runner signals ([#7261](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/7261)).

## [17.2.1] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Added a `postmortem.quit` configuration option to safely handle shutdown paths when the terminal output has already disconnected.
- Added project-keyed OMP security-state directory helpers under the user state root.

## [17.1.8] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Added `setProcessName` utility to set the OS-visible process name on Linux via `bun:ffi`, bypassing Bun's `process.title` limitations.

### Fixed

- Fixed child shell environment filtering to drop launch-directory `.env` values in addition to Bun-autoloaded `.env.local` values.

## [17.1.5] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- `getShellConfig` no longer throws `No bash shell found` on Windows hosts without a discoverable bash. `resolveWindowsShell` searches Git for Windows install roots (machine, per-user, `GIT_INSTALL_ROOT`, scoop app dirs — scoop shims `sh.exe`/`git.exe` but never `bash.exe`), then `bash.exe`/`sh.exe` on PATH, and finally falls back to `cmd.exe` from ComSpec with `/c` args, so shell resolution always succeeds.

## [17.1.4] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Fixed postmortem signal and fatal shutdown exits being intercepted by temporary `process.exit` guards during extension startup ([#6488](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6488)).
- Corrected Windows shell resolution errors to identify the active global, project, overlay, or runtime source for `shellPath` instead of directing every user to the retired `settings.json` file ([#6579](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6579)).
- Contained timed-out child lifecycle rejections so `ptree` callers cannot leak an unhandled `TimeoutError` after settling ([#6635](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/6635)).
- Fixed an invalid configured `shellPath` being silently masked whenever an earlier caller had already resolved a shell in the same process; the guidance error now surfaces regardless of cache state.

## [17.0.9] - 2026-07-23

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed `getAutoQaDbDir` to `getAutoQaDbPath` for accuracy; update any usage accordingly

## [17.0.5] - 2026-07-18

### Changed

- Updated `installRuntimeModuleResolver` to return an uninstaller function that restores the stock `node:module` resolver once all runtime roots are unregistered.
- Added documentation regarding a known limitation with Bun 1.3.14's `createRequire` behavior when the module resolver patch is active.

## [17.0.2] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Added a structured log sink API (`registerLogSink`, `LogEvent`, `LogLevel`) to the centralized logger, enabling out-of-band consumers (such as OpenTelemetry) to receive log events without affecting local file or console logging.

### Changed

- Bounded default `ptree.ChildProcess` stderr retention to a 32 KiB tail to prevent memory leaks in long-lived subprocesses. Full stderr capture must now be explicitly requested at spawn time using `{ stderr: "full" }` on `spawn` or `exec`.

### Fixed

- Fixed fatal cleanup failing to reach `process.exit()` when terminal stderr is revoked.
- Isolated rotating log files and audit state per process to prevent concurrent instances from racing during compression and rotation.

## [17.0.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Added scoped graceful handling for stdio-write EPIPE rejections so protocol servers can await postmortem cleanup when their peer disconnects ([#4788](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/4788)).

## [17.0.0] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Improved SSE streaming performance by batching complete lines into a single UTF-8 decode per chunk, reducing decoder overhead.
- Fixed an issue in `parseFrontmatter` where a single malformed YAML line would corrupt sibling values by parsing each line independently.

## [16.5.2] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Improved CLI argument and flag validation error output to display a concise error message and command usage instead of a minified code frame.
- Corrected required variadic positionals to render as `MODELS...` instead of `[MODELS]` in usage help.

## [16.5.1] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added terminal stderr guard utilities (suppressTerminalStderr and restoreTerminalStderr) to prevent macOS runtime diagnostics from corrupting TUI viewports while ensuring crash reports remain visible.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue in Mermaid ASCII routing where unreachable edge attachment points caused unbounded pathfinder searches.

## [16.4.6] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Added `AsyncDrain`, the deferred write-batching helper previously private to the coding-agent's prompt-history storage; now shared with model-perf recording.

## [16.4.2] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Added `stringifyJson` utility with support for BigInt serialization.

## [16.3.12] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Added `postmortem.interceptUnhandledRejections()` to register interceptors consulted before an unhandled rejection tears the process down; a consuming interceptor (e.g. the JS eval runtime claiming rejections floated by user cell code) keeps the process alive and owns reporting.

### Fixed

- Fixed child shell environment filtering to drop launch-directory `.env.local` values that Bun auto-loaded before OMP starts command shells. ([#4723](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/4723))

## [16.3.10] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Added `postmortem.markExpectedCleanupError()` / `postmortem.isExpectedCleanupError()` to tag errors thrown by routine resource teardown; the global `uncaughtException`/`unhandledRejection` handlers downgrade marked errors (walking the `cause` chain) to warnings instead of exiting the process.

### Fixed

- Bounded postmortem cleanup with a 10s deadline so a hanging cleanup callback can no longer wedge the process indefinitely after a fatal error or signal; the process now always reaches `process.exit`.

## [16.3.7] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- Added `classifyJsonPrefix`, a strict RFC 8259 streaming-buffer classifier (`"complete" | "prefix" | "invalid"`). Providers use it to disambiguate identifierless streaming tool-call deltas: a `{`-prefixed chunk only advances to a sibling call when the current argument buffer cannot absorb it.

## [16.3.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Fixed `parseJsonWithRepair` failing tool calls whose streamed arguments contain an unquoted string value (e.g. `{"paths": packages/foo/*, "i": "…"}`). Final parsing now recovers such barewords in object/array value position as strings, terminating at `,` / `}` / `]` / newline. Recovery deliberately refuses anything that could mask real structure or bad data — truncated values, tokens containing `"` / `{` / `[` or a key-like `:` (URL `://` and Windows `:\` colons stay literal), and non-finite atoms (`NaN`, `Infinity`, `undefined`) — and streaming partial parses still roll back unfinished barewords instead of committing them.

## [16.3.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added `wrapFetchForExtraCa` and `withExtraCaFetch` utility functions to apply `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` to Bun's `RequestInit.tls.ca` configuration.

## [16.2.9] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Improved resilience in `fetchWithRetry()` by adding a response-body retry gate to handle deterministic provider failures that return retryable HTTP statuses.

### Fixed

- Fixed YAML frontmatter parsing for skill descriptions containing unquoted colons (`: `), ensuring typed fields are correctly preserved without triggering unnecessary warnings.

## [16.2.7] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Added a utility to detect binary files based on content sniffing.

## [16.2.6] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Added `stripWindowsExtendedLengthPathPrefix()` utility to normalize `\\?\` and native Win32 path prefixes before Bun import or spawn calls.

## [16.2.3] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- Added `escapeXmlAttribute` utility function for safe XML attribute value encoding.

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash in `ptree.ChildProcess.bytes()` and the `ssh://` read path when handling large subprocess outputs (over 128 KB) under Bun by ensuring it consistently returns a `Uint8Array`.

## [16.2.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Added a relaxed JSON parser supporting single-quoted strings, unquoted keys, and comments.
- Added `parseStreamingJson` and `parseStreamingJsonThrottled` for robust, efficient parsing of truncated or incremental streaming JSON.
- Added an XDG-aware document conversion cache directory helper.
- Exported `removeWithRetries()` as a standalone asynchronous function to handle retry-on-EBUSY cleanup logic.

### Changed

- Improved `readSseJson` to gracefully recover truncated or malformed final events using the streaming JSON parser, ending the stream cleanly instead of throwing.
- Increased the retry delay for EBUSY file-lock errors from 25ms to 50ms (extending the total retry window to 2 seconds) to improve reliability on Windows.

## [16.1.8] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Exported `removeSyncWithRetries()` as a standalone function so tests that manage their own temp dirs can use the same retry-on-EBUSY cleanup logic as `TempDir.removeSync()`.

## [16.1.3] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- Expanded the `TempDir` Windows retry window from 4×10ms to 40×25ms (1s total) to accommodate SQLite WAL/SHM file handle release delays

### Fixed

- Made EPIPE rejections from IPC `send()` to worker subprocesses (`syscall: "send"`) non-fatal: the global `unhandledRejection` handler now logs and continues instead of terminating the session when an optional subsystem's pipe breaks. A broken optional subsystem (TTS/STT/tiny-title/MCP) can no longer crash the whole agent session mid-task. ([#2997](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/2997))

## [16.1.2] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Added `directoryExists(dir)` to `dirs`: resolves whether a path is an existing directory, returning `false` on any stat failure (ENOENT, permission, non-directory). Lets callers check a directory is safe to `chdir` into before `setProjectDir` throws.

### Removed

- Removed the public `createAbortableStream` API from `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils`. Consumers should use the lighter, direct-reader `abortableSource` async generator inside `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils/stream` to avoid the extra ReadableStream wrapper layer and per-chunk enqueue overhead.

## [16.0.11] - 2026-06-19

### Removed

- Removed `getIndentation`, `setDefaultTabWidth`, and `getDefaultTabWidth` helpers

## [16.0.8] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- Mermaid diagrams are now rendered to ASCII by a first-party vendored renderer (`src/vendor/mermaid-ascii`, derived from the MIT-licensed `beautiful-mermaid`, ASCII pipeline only) with terminal display width measured via `Bun.stringWidth` (grapheme-aware, correct for wide/East-Asian glyphs and emoji). Inline label formatting (HTML formatting tags and markdown emphasis) is now reduced to plain text instead of printed raw.

### Removed

- Removed the external `beautiful-mermaid` dependency (and its transitive `elkjs`, ~3.13MB) in favor of the vendored ASCII renderer.

## [16.0.3] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Added `escapeXmlText` utility to escape XML-significant characters `&`, `<`, and `>` in element body text
- Added `isTerminalHeadless()` / `setTerminalHeadless()` to centrally suppress real-terminal side effects (stdout escape/frame writes, stdin raw mode, CSI/OSC capability probes, SIGWINCH, window-title changes, emergency restore) under the test runtime. Defaults on when `bun test` sets `NODE_ENV=test`; terminal-contract tests opt out via `setTerminalHeadless(false)`

## [15.13.3] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Added `installWorkerInbox(port)` / `consumeWorkerInbox()` to `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils/worker-host`. A self-dispatching CLI host that imports a Bun worker module dynamically attaches the worker's real `message` listener after Bun flushes the messages the parent posted before spawn, dropping a synchronously-posted `init`. The host installs this buffering inbox synchronously in the entry's sync prefix so a listener exists at flush time; the worker module consumes it and binds the real handler, replaying anything buffered.

## [15.13.1] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Added profile-aware directory helpers and isolated profile state roots, while keeping the install ID shared across profiles.
- Added a named-profile API to the `dirs` module — `setProfile()`, `getActiveProfile()`, `getProfileRootDir()`, and `normalizeProfileName()` — plus `resolveProfileEnv()`, which selects the active profile from `OMP_PROFILE` (canonical; takes precedence) then `PI_PROFILE` (legacy fallback, consulted only when `OMP_PROFILE` is unset).
- Added support for a runtime `overrides` map in `RuntimeInstallSpec`, which is now written into generated runtime `package.json` manifests to force dependency pins (including transitive ones) across the runtime tree
- Added a lightweight loop-phase breadcrumb stack (`pushLoopPhase`/`popLoopPhase`/`currentLoopPhase`, plus `takeRecentLoopPhase` which returns the live phase or the most recently popped one and clears it) so the TUI event-loop watchdog can attribute a main-thread block to the phase that caused it — including a synchronous phase already popped before the watchdog's delayed tick runs ([#2485](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/2485))
- Added `FetchWithRetryOptions.timeout` (forwarded to the underlying `fetch` call). `false` disables Bun's native ~300s pre-response timeout; a positive number overrides the ceiling. Bare browser/Node fetch ignores it ([#2422](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/2422))
- Added the side-effect-free `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils/worker-host` module (`declareWorkerHostEntry()` / `workerHostEntry()`), extracted from `env` (still re-exported there) so worker spawn sites can resolve the self-dispatching CLI host entry without importing `env`'s side-effecting module graph.

### Fixed

- Fixed profile directory isolation when a profile's agent `.env` customizes directory roots: directory-affecting keys (`XDG_DATA_HOME`/`XDG_STATE_HOME`/`XDG_CACHE_HOME`, and a default-mode `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`) are now honored. The `env` loader rebuilds the `dirs` resolver after applying `.env` files (`refreshDirsFromEnv()`), so a profile `.env` that points XDG roots elsewhere no longer leaks state into the home-based config dir.
- Made `TempDir` cleanup retry transient Windows `EBUSY`/`EPERM`/`ENOTEMPTY` removal failures so tests are less likely to fail when deleting just-used temp directories.
- Fixed `installRuntimeModuleResolver()` to keep bare requests from runtime-cache modules inside that registered runtime before falling back to host/workspace packages.

## [15.12.4] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- Fixed abortable stream wrappers to cancel the source stream on abort, so timeout watchdogs release upstream HTTP bodies instead of only stopping the local reader.

## [15.12.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Added `runtime-install`: shared on-demand runtime dependency support — `ensureRuntimeInstalled()` (locked, idempotent `bun install` of a pinned dependency set into a cache dir) and a multi-root `installRuntimeModuleResolver()`/`resolveRuntimeModule()` for loading those graphs inside compiled binaries (Bun #1763). Extracted from the coding-agent tiny-model worker; now also backs Mnemopi's on-demand fastembed runtime ([#2389](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/2389))
- Added `getFastembedRuntimeDir()` (~/.omp/cache/fastembed-runtime) alongside `getFastembedCacheDir()`

## [15.11.4] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Added `getEditorConfigFormatting(file)`: returns the `.editorconfig`-pinned `tabSize`/`insertSpaces` (both optional, no fallback) so LSP-format callers can layer per-file defaults under it without paving over silence with the renderer's display tab width ([#2329](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/2329)).

## [15.11.3] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Added `getEditorConfigFormatting(file)`: returns the `.editorconfig`-pinned `tabSize`/`insertSpaces` (both optional, no fallback) so LSP-format callers can layer per-file defaults under it without paving over silence with the renderer's display tab width ([#2329](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/2329)).

## [15.11.1] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- Fixed cleanup reentry noise during fatal shutdown: recursive cleanup requests now no-op idempotently instead of logging repeated `Cleanup invoked recursively` errors ([#2284](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/2284)).

## [15.11.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Added the `path-tree` module (`buildPathTree`, `walkPathTree`, `formatGroupedPaths`, `isUrlLikePath`), moved from the coding agent's grouped file output so compaction file lists can share the same prefix-folded directory-tree rendering; `formatGroupedPaths` gains an optional `annotate` callback for per-file suffixes

### Fixed

- Fixed the `{{join}}` prompt helper joining with a literal two-character `\n` when templates pass `"\n"` as the separator — Handlebars string literals carry no escape processing. The separator now unescapes `\n`/`\t`, matching the `{{#list}}` helper's documented convention (visible as literal `\n` between paths in compaction `<read-files>` lists).

## [15.10.11] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Restored `PI_DEBUG_STARTUP` streaming startup markers: `logger.time` now writes a synchronous `[startup] <op>:start` / `:done` / `:fail` stderr line per phase (independent of `PI_TIMING`), so a startup that hangs hard still names the phase it is stuck in — the `PI_TIMING` tree only prints after startup completes and is structurally unable to diagnose a hang. The CLI runner emits `cli:load:<name>` markers around each lazily-imported command module for the same reason.
- Added `logger.openSpanPath()`: ops of the currently-open timing-span chain (root → deepest), used by the coding agent's startup watchdog to name the in-flight phase of a stalled startup.
- Added `declareWorkerHostEntry()` / `workerHostEntry()` (env): self-dispatching CLI entrypoints declare `Bun.main` as the worker host so worker spawn sites can re-enter the single entry module with `WorkerOptions.argv` selectors across source, npm-bundle, and compiled distributions

### Changed

- Changed `prompt.compile()` to cache compiled templates by the raw template string so repeated calls reuse the same compiled function without re-disambiguating
- `Snowflake.formatParts` packs the id as a single 64-bit BigInt hex format instead of stitching four 16-bit segments (simpler and ~1.7x faster), and `getTimestamp` extracts via exact double arithmetic instead of a BigInt round-trip. Output is bit-identical.
- Logger initialization is lazy: the winston logger, file transport, and log-directory creation now happen on first log emission instead of at module import (the import previously cost ~8ms of fs work on the CLI startup path); the in-memory timing infrastructure never touches winston
- `prompt.format()` post-processing got cheap per-line guards and a single-pass ASCII-symbol replacement (was 7 chained regex passes per line), roughly halving render post-processing cost; output is byte-identical

### Fixed

- Fixed `prompt.format()` so ASCII symbol replacements such as `-->` and `!=` still run on lines containing a closing HTML comment token when not inside a comment
- `isCompiledBinary()` now also honors a define-folded `process.env.PI_COMPILED` (only `Bun.env` was checked), so builds that constant-fold `process.env` keep compiled-binary detection without relying on `import.meta.url` bunfs markers
- `omp <cmd> --help` now loads only the requested command module instead of the entire command table, so an unrelated command whose import graph hangs or crashes can no longer take down every per-command help invocation.

## [15.10.8] - 2026-06-09

### Removed

- Removed the exported `hookFetch` API, which previously intercepted `globalThis.fetch` via middleware handlers
- Removed `hookFetch` from the package entrypoint, so imports from `@.../utils` no longer provide this fetch interception helper

## [15.10.0] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- `logger.printTimings()` (the `PI_TIMING` startup tree) now surfaces two previously-invisible regions: a `(before instrumentation)` line for runtime init / uncaptured pre-marker work, and an `(unattributed self)` line for the root span's own untimed work so the gap between visible top-level spans and `Total` is no longer swallowed. `Total` is now labelled `(since first marker)` to make the window explicit. The restored `module-timer.ts` preload can feed module spans into the report: each module records `onLoad` → final top-level marker as `total`, a prepended body marker → final marker as `body/TLA`, and resolved static imports as a bounded dependency tree so the report separates graph wait from actual top-level module work.

## [15.9.2] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Added `getAuthBrokerSnapshotCachePath()` with `OMP_AUTH_BROKER_SNAPSHOT_CACHE` override support for isolating the encrypted broker snapshot cache.

## [15.9.1] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- Hardened `getIndentation` against malformed paths: any filesystem error from the `.editorconfig` probe (e.g. `ENAMETOOLONG` on oversized garbage path segments) is now swallowed and cached as a miss instead of escaping and crashing the TUI mid-render ([#1871](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1871)).
- Fixed `getIndentation` (and the edit renderer's `replaceTabs` callers) crashing with `ENAMETOOLONG`/`ENOTDIR`/etc. when handed a path with an overlong component or a non-directory in its parent chain. Editorconfig discovery now short-circuits to the default tab width on any path component above `NAME_MAX` (255 bytes) and absorbs any `FsError` while walking the editorconfig chain — best-effort discovery must never escape as an uncaught exception ([#1872](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1872)).

## [15.9.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- Added color helpers `colorLuma` (perceptual luma), `relativeLuminance` (WCAG, linearized sRGB), and `hslToHex` to the color utilities. The luminance helpers parse `#rgb`/`#rrggbb` hex and 256-color palette indices, returning `undefined` for unparseable values.
- Added `peekFileEnds`, a single-open head-and-tail file peek helper that reuses the head bytes for the tail when the file fits the head window.
- Added `peekFileTail`, the tail mirror of `peekFile`: reads up to the last `maxBytes` of a file ending at EOF, reusing the same pooled-buffer strategy (no per-call allocation for small reads).

## [15.7.3] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Added `getFastembedCacheDir` to return the FastEmbed model cache directory under ~/.omp/cache/fastembed

### Fixed

- Fixed `$flag` environment parsing to accept lowercase truthy values such as `y`, `true`, `yes`, and `on`

## [15.6.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Added an XDG-aware tiny-title model cache directory helper for coding-agent local title models.
